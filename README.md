Compare the air quality of tennis events by crawling data from internet

Inspired by the comment on air quality of China by Novak Djokovic before Australia Open 2020, I'm curious about which tennis events have the worst air quality in recent years.

The project is under construction. I'm trying to crawl the event information(city and date) from wikipedia and air quality data from Berkeley Earth.
